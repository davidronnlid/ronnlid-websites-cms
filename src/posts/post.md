Test post

- This is a test post. Blog posts with real content will arrive soon.

Ronnlid Websites is owned and founded by David RÃ¶nnlid, 18 years old, web developer (mainly front-end) & entrepreneur. My vision is no less than a world where people are experiencing more well-being. I try to boost love and reduce suffering by accruing power to influence reality, including the society within which the people who can experience more or less valuably exist. This company & coding is a means to that end.
