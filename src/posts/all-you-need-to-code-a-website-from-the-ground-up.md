Coding a website from ground-up is one of the most interesting and challenging tasks for a newbie. The most difficult question of the complete exercise is, where to start from? And what are the essential elements required to ensure a smoothly developed and quality website. Hence we thought to make it easy for all the developers out there to have a look at the aspects and tools required for the development of a website.  Following is a list of all the ingredients required to develop a website from the ground up. 



## 1.	HTML

The First and foremost thing you need is, expertise in Hyper Text Markup Language or as the more popularly known abbreviation: HTML. HTML is the basic building block of any website as it is the language used to develop the skeleton and the content on the page. Without having a proper grip on concepts of HTML, it is very difficult for one to develop a website from the ground up. Hence we start our list of essentials for the development of a website with HTML.  



## 2.	CSS

Once the outline and the content have been developed, now it’s time to enhance the appearance of the webpage. In order to enhance the outlook of the webpage you will need Cascading Style Sheets, also known as CSS. CSS helps in defining the display of the HTML elements. CSS helps a developer in controlling the layouts of multiple web pages simultaneously. It saves a developers workload and provides variety of display options to play with the same HTML code. Hence knowing your way around with CSS is of uppermost importance if you want to make an impressive website that can attract substantial traffic. 



## 3.	Javascript

Until now we have only discussed the statics of a webpage; in order to make things “move” (literally) the developer must know the proper use of Javascript. Javascript is a scripting language that primarily enables the web developer to make the website more interactive by enhancing the HTML code. Examples include interactive slideshows on the page, dropdown menus and other functions that can literally make your website come alive. In the competitive world of web development, it is a must for the developers to implement their coding skills and developing the most interactive website possible, and that is not possible without the proper knowledge and use of JS. Knowing more Javascript is always better, as it will be very useful further down the line if you want to build more complex websites.



## 4.	Code Editor



Next up are the code editors. Code editors greatly help developers to save time and steps during building a website from the ground up. Further, code editors help the developers improve the quality of their code. Multiple cross-platform code editors are available in the market and what matters is the comfort level of a coder with the platform, hence it totally depends on the developer to select a code editor of their liking and use the option they feel the most comfortable with. Visual Studio Code is one option that provide coding flexibility & is great for building your first website. It also occupies very little space on your computer.   



## 5.	DOM Manipulation Knowledge



The DOM or Document Object Model is the structure a web browser generates from your HTML. It is an essential tool in making the website more interactive as in simple words it is the “translator” between the HTML and Javascript. The DOM at times is also called the “DOM tree” as its structure resembles that of a family tree, with “nodes” as the different HTML elements. Knowing your way around with the DOM is important as it lets you take your HTML & JS-knowledge and make it useful for whatever your trying to achieve in your website.



## 6.	Node

Another extremely important aspect for the development of a webpage is the proper understanding of Node (or alternative package manager). Basically, Node is essential for making your development process easy by re-using other people’s code through module packages. Without a package manager like node you’d have to do every single bit of JavaScript for your website, even though the exact same code has been written and quality-checked many times before by skilled developers.

  

## 7.	GitHub

GitHub, the code hosting platform is another essential for the development of a website from the ground up. GitHub works via cloud-storage which provides version control, letting you off the hook if your hard drive crashes, or if you accidentally merge code into your project, and push save. It also allows developers to work together and interact on projects, to resolve issues and find and rectify bugs in code and suggest solutions. In a way, using GitHub for your projects is like “group-thinking”, one problem and multiple solutions. But for your website that you want to code all by yourself, from the ground up, you don’t need GitHub, right? Wrong! GitHub is essential for the next step in the process, where we bring your site to the internet.



## 8.	Netlify

Netlify provides free hosting. It also provides continuous deployment, publishing of your website. Netlify uses your GitHub remote repository of code and deploys the website, it is very easy to use, you can pay $0 and it works straight out of the box!



That’s it, there is the list of essentials that a developer needs to code their website from the ground up. Good luck with your first project!
